# 🌧️ Rain Prediction and Humidity-Temperature Forecasting AI Model

This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at forecasting rainfall, humidity, and temperature. Leveraging historical weather data, the model employs advanced regression techniques to predict weather conditions, facilitating informed decision-making in sectors like agriculture, logistics, and urban planning.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `Weather_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete workflow—from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model training and evaluation.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary Python libraries and dependencies to replicate the environment.

## 🧪 Key Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends, distributions, and correlations within the dataset.
* **Modeling**: Implements multiple regression models, including:

  * Linear Regression
  * Decision Tree Regressor
  * Random Forest Regressor
* **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To set up the environment, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, manually install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
